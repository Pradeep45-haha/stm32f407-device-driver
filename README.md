# stm32f407-device-driver
I DO NOT RECOMMEND USING MY CODE FOR PROFESSIONAL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT.

/***********THIS CODE IS WRITTEN IN SYSTEMWORKBENCH FOR STM32F407VG********************/

My name is Pradeep Sharma I write my own device drives and program embedded systems

This file contains Device driver of SPI, I2C, USART and GPIOs completed and work in progress on DMA and ADC for stm32f407
I am sure that my code is not optimized because I strated learnig embedded system in 2019.
